<h1> How to play ROBLOX</h1>
<h2> First create an account</h2>
<p> Go to www.roblox.com and create a account, birthday , then username (make sure it's not taken!) then create a complex password that you will remember and then write it down in case you forget it, and lastly select if you are a boy or girl.
<h2> Play some games!</h2>
<p> Now you are at your home page, if you are on computer most likely then click on the "Games" it will take you to the front page where all the hottest games are like Jailbreak or Arsenal (13+ advisory) along with meepcity(please be careful for people breaking the rules with inappropriate actions and report them) or Phantom Forces (13+ advisory) Also there are fun obbys that take skill! these are all popular games but you can play whatever you want!
<h2> How to play!</h2>
<p>So join a game now for example meepcity (this is for all games) In order to move forward press "W" in order to move left press "A" to move right press "D" and in order to move backwards press "S". This will help you move around and navigate along with interacting with tools-wait, I didn't tell you how to interact, well lemme teach you! So when there is something such as a key that you're suppose to collect in a game hover your pointer (a triangle looking cursor) over the item (a key for example) a hand with a finger that looks white will pop up left click it, now its in your inventory! To access your inventory look to the bottom of your screen, you can either click the item or press a number that is a tiny number in the corner of the little box of the item, you can select 1-0  to equip your item. In some games you have a TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INVENTORY! At the top of your screen you will see a shaded bar with 3 icons! One is 3 lines stacked (the menu) a chat bubble (the chat) and a backpack! Click on the backpack, that shows all of the remaining inventory you have, click and drag the item you want in you toolbar and drag it there, now its equipped! To use it click or press the number assigned to it then click! Now it works! Next!
<h2> Uh oh, spaghetti o...</h2>
<p> So, Did you get banned? Well, you can either wait if you were banned for a certain amount of of time, but... if you were terminated, go to the support page hyper linked to the notice you got when logging in, think what did you do? If you dont remember, go to the ToS page (Terms Of Service) and if you don't know where it is look up on google "roblox terms of service". Heres some basic rules hacking, exploiting, bullying, scamming... Please follow all rules so you don't get banned or terminated.
<h2> Hey! Download this to get free rob- NO!</h2>
<p> So, you are on YouTube watching some videos y'know chilling enjoying life and then in the middle of your video... Hey! did you know you can get free robux using this website! I got tons of robux! Don't go to any websites that claim to be giving free robux, Well let's start with the most common way of getting hacked, robux generators, robux generators give free robux by entering your username and selecting your device, then doing a human verification by downloading apps, DON"T DO THAT! When you download all 4 or more apps they get money being able to buy robux and then donating it to you, it sounds harmless but it's breaking the ToS and you can get your account terminated for robux loitering. This is actually illegal in the U.S because that person is giving free money because robux cost money, I mean A LOT of money so don't go that route unless, you're despe-no I'm just kidding don't, please dont ok? ok. . The next way of getting hacked is robux websites, yes that sound the same robux generators and robux websites but robux websites are different, on the website you enter your username AND password then choose your robux daa daa dee daa daa doo and then yay! you got some robux- no you didn't you got... DRUMROLL PLEASE! HACKED! Your account just got hacked and they will change your password and boom! you're locked out, and theres nothing you can do about it.Some websites also collect cookies and if you save your password they can get in easily. So thats it, on to the last one! And it is... FREE ROBUX GAMES! on ROBLOX there is a ton of ads and games claiming to give free robux but dont fall for it, you enter the game and then they ask for you password and then the give you nothing but a lost account thats now hacked... sad... :( But wait! I have a way to prevent that! Even if you enter your password! So go into settings (the little gear in the corner) then scroll down and look through every coulumn you will find Two-Step-Verification which then you will click on it and then enter your parent/guardian's e-mail so every time you log in ROBLOX will send a 6 digit code to enter to log in, smart!
<h2> Well, you're one smart player!</h2>
<p> Now, you can play ROBLOX as a beginning pro! Yes, a pro! I've told you alot of stuff that would take a normal player to fid out! Take this knowledge and play on!
